 - A bunch of other stuff! I wrote a [somewhat successful webcomic](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/XDComics) during the web2.0, published a [few good articles](https://www.losreplicantes.com/usuarios/samuel-aneiros/) during the last decade (some of which I oh so badly regret), created an [improv podcast](https://www.ivoox.com/podcast-denominacion-origen-desconocido_sq_f1317456_1.html) about being stuck with my friends in an alien invasion, and learned how to produce, edit and host a comedy / culture [show about boardgames](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSSFM7DSYGxXle54o3tsMAHWNnLgkjgBn), in which I [correctly predicted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCz5GzmK62s) a 600.000€ Kickstarter for a new edition of an old game was actually a scam.
